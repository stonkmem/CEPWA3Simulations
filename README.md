# CEPWA3Simulations
Learning Goals for students include:

1. CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION
    1. Understand the direction of centripetal acceleration, and gain intuition for why this is the case.
    2. Understand how the angular velocity and distance from center affect centripetal acceleration.
2. TANGENTIAL VELOCITY
    1. Understand the relation between the distance from the center and the tangential velocity of a rotating point.
3. CORIOLIS EFFECT
    1. Understand, intuitively, the cause of the Coriolis Effect as the correction required to convert between rotating and nonrotating inertial frames of reference.
    2. Predict the direction of the Coriolis Force term given a point and its velocity relative to the rotating Frame of reference.

The simulation (FINAL: ) assists students in the following learning objectives since it visually provides an intuition of the direction of the centripetal acceleration, along with the corresponding food for thought about the reasons behind this (i.e. the centripetal acceleration changing as the plate rotates). 

In terms of the tangential velocity, I believe the simulation provides a rather simple and basic intuition for the concept.

Lastly, for the Coriolis Effect, I believe that with the velocities presented in the model, the simulation provides both an ability for students to understand the Physical concepts, while also providing the simulation with ‘break’ capacity when the final velocity is aimed towards the center of the plate, which undoubtedly prompts students to find situations where the Coriolis Force is minimised (i.e. when the final velocity relative to the frame reaches 0).
